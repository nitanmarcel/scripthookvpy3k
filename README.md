## Contributing
All contributions are warmly welcomed. Below are a few hints to the entry points of the
code and a link to our to do list.

### Entry Points
* ``Py3kWrapperStart`` in [wrapper.cpp](/cpp/src/wrapper.cpp) is the entry point for the
  C++ part of the plugin
* ``_init`` in [the gta module](/python/gta/__init__.py) is the entry point for the
  Python part of the plugin

### Todo
See [TODO.md](/TOO.md).

## Building
If you want to build the ASI plugin yourself, you'll need:

1. Visual Studio 2013
2. The [Script Hook V SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) which has to be
   extracted into [/sdk](/sdk) after downloading
3. [SWIG](http://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/) Version >= 3.0.5 which has
   to be extracted into [/swig](/swig) after downloading
4. **Python 3.5.0 for AMD64/EM64T/x64**. Using the x86 version will not work!
5. Open the project file and build the solution in *Release* configuration
